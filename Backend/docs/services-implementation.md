### 3. FileUploadService (`app/Services/Admin/FileUploadService.php`)

**Purpose**: Handles secure file uploads with validation, optimization, and security measures.

**Key Features**:
- Image upload with validation and optimization
- Document upload with security checks
- File type and size validation
- Security validation (executable file detection)
- Image optimization using GD library
- Secure filename generation
- File deletion and information retrieval
- Comprehensive logging

**Key Methods**:
- `uploadImage()` - Upload and validate image files
- `uploadDocument()` - Upload and validate document files

- MIME type validation
- Executable file detection and blocking
- Image content validation
- Secure filename generation with timestamps and random strings

### 4. AuditLogService (`app/Services/Admin/AuditLogService.php`)

**Purpose**: Provides comprehensive audit logging for all admin operations and system events.

**Key Features**:
- Categorized logging (auth, crud, file, security, config, etc.)
- Contextual information capture (IP, user agent, memory usage)
- Performance monitoring (slow query logging)
- Audit statistics and search capabilities
- Log cleanup functionality

- `logFileOperation()` - Log file operations
- `logSecurityEvent()` - Log security events
- `logConfigChange()` - Log configuration changes
- `logError()` - Log error events
- `logApiRequest()` - Log API requests with performance data
- `logSlowQuery()` - Log slow database queries
- `logBulkOperation()` - Log bulk operations
- `logMaintenanceEvent()` - Log maintenance events
- `getAuditStatistics()` - Get audit statistics
- `searchAuditLogs()` - Search audit logs
- `cleanOldLogs()` - Clean old audit logs

## Service Registration

All services are properly registered in `app/Providers/RepositoryServiceProvider.php` with dependency injection:

```php
$this->app->bind(\App\Services\Admin\ContactService::class, function ($app) {
    return new \App\Services\Admin\ContactService(
        $app->make(\App\Repositories\Contracts\ContactRepositoryInterface::class)
    );
});

$this->app->bind(\App\Services\Admin\SettingsService::class, function ($app) {
    return new \App\Services\Admin\SettingsService(
        $app->make(\App\Repositories\Contracts\SettingsRepositoryInterface::class)
    );
});

$this->app->bind(\App\Services\Admin\FileUploadService::class, function ($app) {
    return new \App\Services\Admin\FileUploadService();
});

$this->app->bind(\App\Services\Admin\AuditLogService::class, function ($app) {
    return new \App\Services\Admin\AuditLogService();
});
```

## Exception Handling

The `FileUploadException` class (`app/Exceptions/Admin/FileUploadException.php`) provides specific exception handling for file upload operations with static factory methods:

- `fileSizeExceeded()` - For oversized files
- `invalidFileType()` - For invalid file types
- `corruptedFile()` - For corrupted files
- `storageFailed()` - For storage failures
- `securityViolation()` - For security violations
- `missingFile()` - For missing files

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests have been created for all services:

- `tests/Unit/Services/ContactServiceTest.php` - Tests for ContactService
- `tests/Unit/Services/SettingsServiceTest.php` - Tests for SettingsService
- `tests/Unit/Services/FileUploadServiceTest.php` - Tests for FileUploadService
- `tests/Unit/Services/AuditLogServiceTest.php` - Tests for AuditLogService
- `tests/Unit/Services/ServiceIntegrationTest.php` - Integration tests
