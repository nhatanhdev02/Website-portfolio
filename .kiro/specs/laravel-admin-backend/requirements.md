# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a Laravel backend API system to support the "Nháº­t Anh Dev - Freelance Fullstack" portfolio admin dashboard. The backend will implement Clean Architecture principles, provide RESTful APIs for content management, and include comprehensive authentication, logging, and testing capabilities.

## Requirements

5. WHEN about content changes THEN the system SHALL log the modification with user details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage Services via RESTful API, so that I can perform CRUD operations and reorder services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin sends GET request to `/admin/services` THEN the system SHALL return paginated list of services ordered by position
2. WHEN an admin sends POST request to `/admin/services` with valid data THEN the system SHALL create service and return 201 with service data
3. WHEN an admin sends PUT request to `/admin/services/{id}` THEN the system SHALL update specific service and return updated data
4. WHEN an admin sends DELETE request to `/admin/services/{id}` THEN the system SHALL soft delete service and return 204 status
5. WHEN an admin sends PUT request to `/admin/services/reorder` with position array THEN the system SHALL update service order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage Portfolio Projects via API, so that I can handle project CRUD operations with image management and categorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin sends GET request to `/admin/projects` THEN the system SHALL return projects with filtering by category and featured status
2. WHEN an admin creates new project THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and handle multiple image uploads
3. WHEN an admin updates project THEN the system SHALL allow partial updates and maintain image relationships
4. WHEN an admin deletes project THEN the system SHALL remove associated images and return confirmation
5. WHEN an admin toggles featured status THEN the system SHALL update project priority and log the change

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage Blog Posts via API, so that I can handle content creation, publishing workflow, and draft management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin sends GET request to `/admin/blog` THEN the system SHALL return posts with status filtering (draft/published)
2. WHEN an admin creates blog post THEN the system SHALL save as draft by default and validate markdown content
3. WHEN an admin publishes post THEN the system SHALL update status, set publish date, and validate required fields
4. WHEN an admin uploads blog thumbnail THEN the system SHALL optimize image and associate with post
5. WHEN blog post is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and log changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage Contact Messages via API, so that I can view, mark as read, and delete messages with bulk operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin sends GET request to `/admin/contacts/messages` THEN the system SHALL return paginated messages with read status
2. WHEN an admin marks message as read THEN the system SHALL update read status and timestamp
3. WHEN an admin deletes messages THEN the system SHALL support both single and bulk delete operations
4. WHEN contact info is updated THEN the system SHALL validate email format and URL formats for social links
5. WHEN new contact message arrives THEN the system SHALL store with unread status and timestamp

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage System Settings via API, so that I can configure language preferences, themes, and maintenance mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is organized THEN the system SHALL separate Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Models into distinct layers
2. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL contain logic in Service classes, not Controllers or Models
